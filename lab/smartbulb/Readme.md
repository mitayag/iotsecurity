# IoT Security Lab: Smart Bulb Vulnerability Analysis
A hands-on laboratory for learning IoT security concepts through a simulated smart bulb device.

## 📝 Overview
This laboratory provides a safe, controlled environment for students to learn about IoT security by analyzing and testing a simulated smart bulb. Students will perform various security tests and understand common IoT vulnerabilities.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand basic IoT device functionality
- Identify common security vulnerabilities in IoT devices
- Execute and analyze basic security tests
- Learn about real-time attack impacts
- Develop basic security testing skills

## 🛠️ Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed
- Basic understanding of command line
- Text editor (VSCode, Notepad++, etc.)
- Web browser (Chrome/Firefox recommended)

## 📦 Required Packages
```bash
pip install flask flask-socketio
```

## 🚀 Quick Start
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd smartbulb
